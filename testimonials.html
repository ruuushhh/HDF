                               " I was a part of the legal team for the Company's Act, which focused on Corporate Social Responsibility in particular. While there isn't much, we as a team could do in comparison to others (the act and the provisions we were given should be judged), I believe my team did a fantastic job. We were given enough instruction and the coaching was flexible. Overall, I had a fantastic time. "
